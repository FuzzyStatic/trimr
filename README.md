## What is `trimr`

Do you work in a high velocity environment where you are constantly creating new branches on your fork for all your feature contributions? Do you find you have an abundance of merged local branches you no longer use? The `trimr` application aims to make clean-up of those stale branches simple.

## TODO

- Auto-generate binaries
- Initial release
- Ability to trim remote branches
